# 🧠 Quantum Computing Library

A lightweight, beginner-friendly **Quantum Computing** library built in Python. This project aims to provide basic quantum operations for learning, experimenting, and prototyping quantum concepts.

---

## ✨ Features

The library currently supports the following quantum operations:

- `MM` → **Matrix Multiplication**  
- `normVec` → **Normalized Vector Calculation**  
- `EOS` → **Evolution of Quantum States**  
- `MCheck` → **Check if a Matrix is Unitary or Hermitian**  
- `Eigs` → **Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**  
- `tensor` → **Tensor Product of Two Matrices**  
- `QC` → **Mini Quantum Circuit Simulation**

> 🔘 Users are prompted to:  
> `Pick one operation to perform:`  
> `Matrix Multiplication(MM)`  
> `normalized vector calculation(normVec)`  
> `Evolution of states calculation(EOS)`  
> `Is Unitary or Hermitian(MCheck)`  
> `Eigenvalues and eigenvectors(Eigs)`  
> `Calculate tensor product of two matrices(tensor)`  
> `mini QC(QC)`

## 🚧 Work in Progress

- 🔄 More quantum operations and gate simulations are being added  
- 🖼️ A **graphical user interface (GUI)** is planned to make the tool more interactive and user-friendly  
- 🧪 Eventually targeting a minimal quantum circuit builder and visualizer
